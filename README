This is a simple scraper to dot file generator that parses MIT's Mathematics (Course 18) pages
and generates a directed graph.  It could be used for other courses.

See the png or svg for examples of the final dot rendering, or look at the dot file for generated dependencies.

Motivation: If you hear about an interesting subject, it's helpful to know the general prerequisites for it. 
This is top-down course planning instead of bottom up.  It's always helpful to ask your advisor, but this 
visualization can help you get an idea of the right questions to ask beforehand.  It gives you the big picture.
