=About

This is a simple scraper to dot file generator that parses MIT's Mathematics (Course 18) pages
and generates a directed graph.  It could be used for other courses.

See math-cropped.png for an excerpt from the example below.

Usage:

  $ ruby course.rb
  [#<MITCourse:0x7fa589618cb8
    @name="Complex Variables with Applications",
    @number="18.04",
    @prerequisites=
     ["18.02", "18.02A", "18.022", "18.023", "18.024", "18.03", "18.034"]>]
  $ dot -Tpng math.dot -o math.png

Motivation: If you hear about an interesting subject, it's helpful to know the general prerequisites for it. 
This is top-down course planning instead of bottom up.  It's always helpful to ask your advisor, but this 
visualization can help you get an idea of the right questions to ask beforehand.  It gives you the big picture.
